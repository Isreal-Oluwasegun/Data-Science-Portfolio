This project
- Explore various features in the housing price in California dataset
- Clean the dataset
- Identify some features that determines housing price
- Identify outliers and remove them
- Train a model(Ridge) that can predict housing price
- Test the model to see if it can generalize
- Communicate the result in form of
- Visualization ( Mapbox Open street map).
  
CONCLUSION 
- It was observed that houses around the coastline have higher price.
- Using equation for technical viewers 
- Using interactive dashboard 
    
This project is a self chosen project to enhance my knowledge in my current study in data science at WorldQuant university.

I will appreciate feedback on areas I need to improve on for better result. Thanks
